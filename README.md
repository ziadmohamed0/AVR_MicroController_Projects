# Embedded Projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects that I have worked on. The projects involve various microcontrollers, such as AVR and ESP8266, and cover a wide range of applications, from assistive technology to home automation.

## Projects

### 1. **Glove for Deaf (AVR)**
- **Microcontroller**: AVR
- **Description**: A glove designed to help the deaf community by converting sign language gestures into text or speech.

### 2. **Smart Lock Door System (AVR)**
- **Microcontroller**: AVR
- **Description**: A smart lock system for doors, using embedded systems to control access based on various inputs like RFID, PIN, or biometric data.

### 3. **Cozmo Robot Eyes (ESP8266)**
- **Microcontroller**: ESP8266
- **Display**: OLED LCD
- **Description**: A robotic eye project with the Cozmo robot's design using ESP8266 and an OLED LCD. It demonstrates robotic motion and display features.

### 4. **Stopwatch Project (AVR)**
- **Microcontroller**: AVR
- **Description**: A simple stopwatch system designed with AVR, showcasing time tracking and control features.

### 5. **Smart Home (AVR)**
- **Microcontroller**: AVR
- **Description**: A smart home automation system using AVR to control devices such as lights, fans, and security systems based on sensor data.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Arduino IDE** (or any compatible IDE for embedded development).
- **AVR Board** (or **ESP8266 Board** for relevant projects) installed in Arduino IDE.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ziadmohamed0/Embedded_Projects.git
   ```

2. **Install necessary libraries**:
   - For the AVR projects: Install the required AVR libraries and drivers.
   - For the ESP8266 projects: Install the ESP8266 board support in Arduino IDE.
   - For OLED LCD (Cozmo project): Install `Adafruit_SSD1306` and `Adafruit_GFX` libraries.

3. **Upload the code** to your microcontroller using the IDE.

4. **Connect your components** as per the wiring diagram provided in each project folder.

## Project Structure
